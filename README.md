This is a fast, simple and super lightweight IPv6 network scanner with graphical interface written with C#, [SharpPcap](https://github.com/chmorgan/sharppcap) and [PacketNet](https://github.com/chmorgan/packetnet).
A very helpful article about IPv6 address scanning can be found here: [Sanning IPv6 Networks](https://www.dionach.com/blog/scanning-ipv6-networks/)

## The Networkscan
NetScanner sends four ICMPv6 Echo-Request messages over the specified network card. The following scopes are used:
```
- FF01::1 (Interface-local all Nodes)
- FF01::2 (Interface-local all Routers)
- FF02::1 (Link-local all Nodes)
- FF02::2 (Link-local all Routers)
```
The entire scanning process takes a maximum of 8 seconds. Depending on the response, the different interfaces are assigned to the scopes.
